/// Base Environment class to support ONNX based inference of RL models. This
/// class is used to define the environment for the agents to interact with.
///
/// The Environment should be defined by the compiler pass that is using the
/// MLCompilerBridge. The environment should be defined by inheriting from this
/// class and implementing the step() and reset() methods.
///
/// step() and reset() are typical methods used in RL environments.
///
/// The step() method takes an action as input and returns the observation
/// corresponding to the next state. The reset() method returns the initial
/// observation.
///
/// Usage:
/// 1. Create an environment class inheriting from MLBridge::Environment
/// 2. Implement step() and reset() methods
///
/// Example:
/// \code
/// class MyEnvironment : public MLBridge::Environment {
/// public:
///   Observation &step(Action action) override {
///     // Implement the step function here
///   }
///   Observation &reset() override {
///     // Implement the reset function here
///   }
/// };
/// \endcode
///
/// This environment can then be used by the ONNXModelRunner to interact with
/// the agents. getNextAgent() and setNextAgent() methods can be used to set the
/// next agent to interact with. These methods are used in step() and reset() to
/// get the next agent to interact with in case of multi-agent environment.
